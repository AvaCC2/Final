      <h1>Evidence</h1>
      <img src="images/bigfoot 2.jpeg" alt="evidence">
      <p>The most notorious piece of evidence that we have of Bigfoot is the 1967 film by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin. The two men were riding horses when they claimed to have spotted a hairy creature walking on two feet. The video, which you likely have seen or atleast images of, shows Bigfoot walking across a river, turning to look at the camera, then continues walking. Other than this and the footprint sighting that happened in 1958, there's little evidence revealing Bigfoots existence. The authenticity of this film, however, is still up for debate.</p>


      <h2>Where He's been spotted</h2>
      <img src="images/bigfoot 10.jpeg" alt="locations">
      <p>People have claimed to have seen Bigfoot all across the nation and even variations of him all throughout the world. In the past, Bigfoot has been said to be spotted in dark forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. Oregon, Washington, California, Florida, and Ohio are said to be Bigfoots place of residence. Outside of the United States, claims have come far and wide from Asia, South Africa, and Australia.</p>

      <h2>Mysterious Noises</h2>
      <p>Many campers and forest goers have claimed to have heard mysterious noises, not coming from the obvious forest animal like bears, wolves, or critters, but from something else... It’s been said that Bigfoot can make an innumerable amount of noises including loud knocks, screams, howls, hums, whistles, and more. He’s a creature with a wide range, that’s for sure. The next time you are out in the forest, listen closely and you may hear the presence of Bigfoot nearby.</p>
