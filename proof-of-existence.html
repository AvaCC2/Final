      <h2>Evidence</h2>
      <img src="images/bigfoot 2.jpeg" alt="evidence" class="image-right">
      <p>The most notorious piece of evidence that we have of Bigfoot is the 1967 film by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin. The two men were riding horses when they claimed to have spotted a hairy creature walking on two feet. The video, which you likely have seen or atleast images of, shows Bigfoot walking across a river, turning to look at the camera, then continues walking. Other than this and the footprint sighting that happened in 1958, there's little evidence revealing Bigfoots existence. The authenticity of this film, however, is still up for debate.</p>


      <h2>Where He's been spotted</h2>
      <img src="images/bigfoot 10.jpeg" alt="locations" class="image-right">
      <p>People have claimed to have seen Bigfoot all across the nation and even variations of him all throughout the world. In the past, Bigfoot has been said to be spotted in dark forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. Oregon, Washington, California, Florida, and Ohio are said to be Bigfoots place of residence. Outside of the United States, claims have come far and wide from Asia, South Africa, and Australia.</p>

      <h2>Mysterious Noises</h2>
      <p>Many campers and forest goers have claimed to have heard mysterious noises, not coming from the obvious forest animal like bears, wolves, or critters, but from something else... It’s been said that Bigfoot can make an innumerable amount of noises including loud knocks, screams, howls, hums, whistles, and more. He’s a creature with a wide range, that’s for sure. The next time you are out in the forest, listen closely and you may hear the presence of Bigfoot nearby.</p>

          <h3>The Yeti</h3>
          <img src="images/yeti funky_compressed.jpg" alt="yeti"/>
          <figcaption>In the Himalayas, the Yeti, or Abominable Snowman, is a large, white haired creature similar to Bigfoot, believed to guard the snowy mountains. "The Yeti is rooted in religion, specifically the pre-Buddhist religion Bön. This group prayed to the  hunting god, who they deemed the ruler of the forests’ creatures. This god would come to be known as the Yeti, but during this time, it was the “Glacier Being.”(Tibettravel.org) </figcaption>

          <h3>The Yeren</h3>
          <img src="images/Yeren.jpeg" alt="yeren">
          <figcaption>Claimed to have been spotted in Asia, the Yeren resembles characteristics of dark red-brown hair and an unkempt appearance. The Yeren's eerie echos in the night make him a fearsome foe. There have been many alleged sightings from locals in China along with physical evidence of hair. An investigation opened following the increasing number of eye-witness reports. The reddish-brown hair was found and tested, but found no conculsive results.</figcaption>

          <figure class="yowie-image"><img src="images/yowie pt2.png" alt="yowie"></figure>
          <figcaption>The Yowie in Australian culture describes the Bigfoot like beast as a ferocious being with a broad frame and varies in color from auburn to black. It's said it can run three times as fast as a human, having long toes and wide feet helping its stride. In 1795 Sydney Australia, settlers reported sightings of tall, wild hairy ape-like men.  </figcaption>
