      <h2>Bigfoots Origin</h2>
      <section class=column>
      <img src="images/pacific northwest 1.jpeg" alt="Bigfoots-Origin" class="image-right image-size">
      <p>The name “Sasquatch” was first introduced by John W. Burns, a schoolteacher living on the Chehalis Indian Reserve in British Columbia. The people of the Chehalis Indian Reserve told many stories, a prominent one being about wild hairy giants living in the forest reserves of the Pacific Northwest. In 1929, Burns wrote an article for the Canadian magazine named <em>Maclean’s</em> sharing the local indigenous stories of a giant ape-like creature. The name Sasquatch, which translates to “wild man” from the word "Sasq'ets in Sts'ailes language (formerly known as Chehalis).</p>

      <h2>Meaning and Roots</h2>
      <section class=column>
      

        <p>For many Indigenous communities, Sasquatch was never just a mysterious creature hiding in the woods. He represented a sign of respect for the land and a reminder that humans aren't the only powerful beings in nature. Among the Sts’ailes people, stories describe Sasq’ets as a being that watches over the forest and keeps people safe when they follow the right path. Those stories weren't meant to scare, but to teach respect and awareness of the natural world around us.</p>

        <p>Although my own experience with what I thought might have been Bigfoot felt much different from this, it still left me with the same feeling of respect for the unknown. The stories told by Indigenous people describe Sasq’ets as a guardian, while what I felt that day in the woods was more unsettling. However, both remind me that there are things in nature we don’t and might not ever fully understand.</p>

        <p>
        The Chehalis people viewed Sasquatch as a spritual guardian who helped warn hunters of danger. He’s viewed as a forest guardian, protector of the wilderness. This original viewpoint has separated itself and now people have taken on multiple different views of Sasquatch as being either a vicious creature or a chill guy.

        <p>Bigfoot didn’t start to gain more traction until 1958 when
        lumberjacks in Northern California, discovered 16 inch footprints along a dirt road. <em>Humboldt Times</em> journalist, Andrew Genzoli, wrote about these footprints in a newspaper column, spreading awareness about this mysterious creature. 
        Thus, the name Bigfoot was born.</p>

      <h2>Gigantopithecus</h2>
        <section class="column">

      <p>
        According to the Smithsonian magazine, an extinct species called the "Gigantopithecus", similar to the appearance of an orangutan, roamed South Asia around 300,000 years ago. Paleontologists discovered the fossils of this species which allowed them to estimate that they were 10 feet tall and weighed 1,200 pounds, similar to Bigfoots description. Scientists in China also concluded that after examining the Gigantopithecus's teeth fossils, its DNA resembled closer to a bear rather than an ape. Although this animal has been extinct for 300,000 years, some people relate this pre-historic species to Bigfoot, believing it IS Bigfoot or his predecessor. However, we cannot be 100% sure that this is true. This would mean that Bigfoot is a descendant of a bear and not human related as initially thought to be. </p>
