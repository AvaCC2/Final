      <h2>My Experience</h2>
 
      <img src="images/bigfoot structure.jpg" class="image-right image-size" alt="bigfoot-structure">
     

      <p>When I was younger, my cousins and I spent a lot of time playing in the woods behind their house. One afternoon, we sumbled upon a structure made out of sticks and branches. We've never built anything out there and there were no other people living nearby. Random trash and snack wrappers were scattered around, which was unusual to be in the middle of the woods. </p>

      <p>We looked around and noticed abnormally huge footprints pressed into the dirt, too big to be any of ours. After that, the woods suddenly felt different, as if we were being watched. We ran back to their house, but that eerie feeling stuck with me. To this day I wonder if what we experienced was Bigfoot.</p>

      <p>Since then, I have been fascinated by the unknown and drawn to mystery shows like the cartoon <em>Gravity Falls</em> and documentaries about people exploring the wilderness. That curiosity inspired me learn more about the legend of Bigfoot and make my website about Him, to share what I've discovered. </p>
