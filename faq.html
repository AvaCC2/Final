      <p>Yes, there are believed to be at least 2,000 Sasquatches in the world. Consisting of both young and old Bigfoots. Families of them potentially roam the forests.</p>

      <h4>What do scientists say about Bigfoot?</h4>
      <p>Most scientists are skeptical in Bigfoots existence due to the lack of evidence. No bones, hair samples, or DNA have proved him to be real.

Many researchers argue that if a population of large primates existed, we would have found more concrete proof by now. </p>

      <h4>Has the FBI investigated Bigfoot?</h4>

Evidence of Bigfoots existence would transition his place in folklore to scientific fact. Tourism might increase in places associated with Bigfoot along with merchandise sales and more people would search for Bigfoot. If people saw that he was real, they would be more willing to believe in other cryptids and  previously unimaginable possibilities.</p>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>

      <p>When I was younger, my cousins and I spent a lot of time playing in the woods behind her house. One day, we found a strange structure made out of sticks and branches. We've never built anything out there and there were no one other people nearby. There was also random trash around it, which was weird for the middle of the woods. We looked around and noticed big and abnormal footprints on the ground, too big to be either of ours. After that, the whole area felt off, as if we were being watched. To this day I've wondered what that was and if it was Bigfoots doing.</p>

      <p>Regardless if you're a believer or skeptic, that doesn't mean he isn't out there. Persist in your search for him and stay curious. Although the existence of Bigfoot is still unknown,he is a prominent figure living in the root of our imaginations and hearts.</p>
