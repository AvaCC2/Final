        <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Is He real?</h4>
            </li>
          <p>This is a tricky question because although there have been so many reported sightings of him, no evidence has been 100% conclusive.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>What's Bigfoots diet?</h4>
          </li>
           
          <p>Since Bigfoot is believed to be a large mammal, many think he would follow an omnivorous diet consisting of eating mostly fish, elk, deer, rodents, plants, and fruits. </p>

        
          <li>
            <h4>How tall is Bigfoot?</h4>
          <p>He's been described to be 6-19 feet tall.</p>
          </li>

        
          <li>
            <h4>Are there more than one Bigfoot?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>Yes, there are believed to be at least 2,000 Sasquatches in the world. Consisting of both young and old Bigfoots. Families of them potentially roam the forests.</p>
       

       
          <li>
            <h4>What do scientists say about Bigfoot?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>Most scientists are skeptical of His existence due to the lack of evidence. No bones, hair samples, or DNA have proved him to be real. There are also no clear photos or videos that can identify Bigfoots actuality. Many researchers argue that if a population of large primates existed, we would have found more concrete proof by now. </p>
       
        
          <li>
            <h4>Has the FBI investigated Bigfoot?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>Yes. The FBI conducted a DNA test on what was initially believed to be Bigfoots hair, but was found to be deer hair. </p>
       
      
          <li>
            <h4>What would happen if Bigfoot was proven real?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>If Bigfoot were proven to exist with undeniable evidence of fossils, a body, or clear camera footage, this would open the door to new possibilities. Evidence of Bigfoots existence would transition his place in folklore to scientific fact. Tourism might increase in places associated with Bigfoot along with merchandise sales and more people would search for Bigfoot. If people saw that he was real, they would be more willing to believe in other cryptids and  previously unimaginable possibilities.</p>
               

         <li>
