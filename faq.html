          <h4>What would happen if Bigfoot was proven real?</h4>
          <p>If Bigfoot were proven to exist with undeniable evidence of fossils, a body, or clear camera footage, this would open the door to new possibilities. Evidence of Bigfoots existence would transition his place in folklore to scientific fact. Tourism might increase in places associated with Bigfoot along with merchandise sales and more people would search for Bigfoot. If people saw that he was real, they would be more willing to believe in other cryptids and  previously unimaginable possibilities.</p>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>

      <p>When I was younger, my cousins and I spent a lot of time playing in the woods behind their house. One day, we found a strange structure made out of sticks and branches. We've never built anything out there and there were no other people living nearby. Random trash and snack wrappers were there, which was weird to be in the middle of the woods. We looked around and noticed abnormally huge footprints on the ground, too big to be any of ours. After that, the whole area felt off, as if we were being watched. To this day I wondered if it was Bigfoot.</p>

      <p>Regardless if you're a believer or skeptic, that doesn't mean he isn't out there. Persist in your search for him and stay curious. Although the existence of Bigfoot is still unknown,he is a prominent figure living in the root of our imaginations and hearts.</p>
